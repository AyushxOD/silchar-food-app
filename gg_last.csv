Worst Experience Ever — Not Worth Your Money or Time!

We ordered half plates of Paneer Biryani and Mutton Biryani, and what we got was not just overpriced but outright deceitful. A full plate of Paneer Biryani costs ₹130 and Mutton ₹299, so how on earth can a half plate cost ₹99 and ₹209 respectively? This is ridiculous pricing with no logic whatsoever — it feels like they're just making up the prices as they go.

To make matters worse, we had about 140 reward points, which should have given us around ₹60 off, but they refused to apply it, claiming their system wouldn’t allow it. We asked them to deduct it manually, but they kept giving the excuse, “we’ll cut it next time if you visit again.” Why would any system not allow a basic reward redemption? Feels like a blatant scam.

Their hospitality was downright terrible. The behavior of both the cash counter guy and an older staff member was rude and arrogant — no respect for regular customers. And mind you, this isn’t the first time they’ve acted this way. We've tolerated a lot, but this time they really crossed the line.

Also, the Mutton Biryani was full of bones, barely any actual meat. And when we questioned it, they gave us lame, rehearsed excuses like they’ve been doing this all the time.

Highly disappointed. Being a regular customer, I expected basic decency. Avoid this place at all costs — there are far better and more respectful eateries out there.

Most shockingly, they also asked us to give a 5-star review — clearly trying to manipulate online ratings instead of improving their service.

Shree Nawab Restaurant, Central Road (owner)

Dear Ms. Ishani Bhattacharjee,
Thank you for taking the time to write to us and for being a valued regular guest of Shree Nawab Restaurant. We are extremely sorry to hear about your recent experience, and we take your feedback with the seriousness and urgency it deserves.

First and foremost, please accept our sincerest apologies for the disappointment, frustration, and disrespect you felt during your visit. Your loyalty means a lot to us, and it is deeply concerning to know that we failed to meet your expectations.



Regarding Pricing Transparency:

You’re absolutely right to question the pricing of half plates. We acknowledge that the current pricing model lacks clarity, and this can come across as unfair. We are in the process of standardizing and clearly communicating half-plate pricing on our menu to avoid confusion going forward. We appreciate you bringing this to our attention.



On Reward Points:



We are equally concerned to learn that you were denied the use of your earned reward points. While technical issues can occasionally occur, they should never result in a customer feeling cheated or dismissed. A manual adjustment should have been offered without hesitation. We are reviewing this incident internally and will ensure that such lapses do not occur again. As a gesture of goodwill, we would like to credit ₹200 worth of reward points to your account immediately.



Staff Conduct:



What you described regarding the behavior of our staff is completely unacceptable and not reflective of our values. We are already identifying the individuals involved, and necessary corrective action — including retraining and disciplinary measures — will be taken. Every guest, especially a loyal one like yourself, deserves to be treated with respect, empathy, and professionalism at all times.



Food Quality:



Your comment about the Mutton Biryani containing mostly bones is very concerning. We are investigating this with our kitchen team and quality control staff. Our goal is to ensure that every portion served meets high standards — in quality, portion, and presentation. Any deviation from this is not acceptable to us either.



On Asking for Reviews:



We apologize if you were asked to leave a review while your concerns were unresolved. That should never happen. Genuine service must always come first, and only then can feedback — whether good or bad — be honestly requested.

Please know that we are taking this matter very seriously and are implementing the following actions:

Revising pricing policy for half plates.

Overhauling the handling of reward point redemptions.

Conducting customer service training for all front-end staff.

Auditing portion quality across key dishes.



We truly value your patronage and your honesty. While we are saddened that we let you down, we are grateful that you cared enough to tell us. If you would consider giving us another opportunity to serve you, we would be more than happy to make things right — not just in words, but through actions.



Please feel free to reach out to me directly at (sent details in
Mail) should you wish to discuss this further. We genuinely hope to regain your trust.



Warm regards,

Ronnie dev

On behalf of Shree Nawab Restaurant Management

Thank you for ordering from shree nawab . First, the coke is charged ₹39-₹43 after all discounts. It was filled full glass. But as i can see , this is a swiggy order, the riders mishandles the glass and spilled on the way. Sorry for the inconveniences. Please raise your concern in swiggy app . Second the raita is of 50 ml which is standard for all our add ons @ ₹14. Thank you for your feedback. We will look into it .

I recently visited this place and unfortunately, the experience was not satisfying. We ordered two dishes: the Bamboo Chicken Biryani and the Hyderabadi Mutton Biryani. While the Bamboo Chicken Biryani was just average and lacked any standout flavors, the Hyderabadi Mutton Biryani was completely tasteless. It lacked the rich, aromatic spices that one would expect from a proper Hyderabadi biryani, making it quite disappointing.

The worst part of the experience was the lack of basic accompaniments. Most places I've been to across various cities serve a small bowl of cucumber and onion with the biryani, and if you ask for extra, they're usually happy to provide it. However, when I requested some onion pieces since they didn't serve any with biryani, the waiter informed me that I would have to buy a salad. This was shocking, as something as simple as onions should be standard with biryani. The waiter even refused to accommodate the request, which highlighted the poor customer service at the restaurant.

Sadly, I wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking for a good biryani experience.

We ordered 7 biryani and it took 1 hour to serve that. Even at the time of serving also the workers are not listening to us. They are not friendly. And the food was not properly cooked. Chilli chicken is half cooked only.. I won't recommend anyone this hotel.

The restaurant has a nice atmosphere — clean, asthetic and comfortable (3 out of 5). However, the food was disappointing. I also ordered a cheese naan(₹120), and it was supposed to be cheesy, but they just added cheese on top like a topping instead of baking it into the naan. The dishes were quite expensive, but the taste didn’t match the price. Not worth it overall.

Had the following dishes:-
1. Chicken Drums of heaven(basically Chicken lollypop), tasted too salty as too much soya sauce was used.🥴👎
2. French Fry(good but less quantity).🤏👍
3. Chicken Dry fry. It was not at all good, too much vegetables used in this dish made it Soggy.😔👎
4. Coffee was good.👍
5. Service was good.👍
6. Washroom couldn't be seen. Directions or instruction must be visible so that customers don't feel embarrassed to ask.🤔
7. Average Price per person was Moderate.
8. Sitting arrangement was good.👍
9. Only*UPI & Cash payment option available, No Debit/Credit card payment option available as of now.
Overall this was the firsthand experience and observation, hope they take it positively to improve on those points.🙏

I tried their Dhosa and Edli. The Dosa was a true delight. It was incredibly thin and crispy, yet surprisingly sturdy. The filling was generously packed and bursting with flavor. The accompanying chutneys and sambar were delicious and perfectly complemented the Dosa. The Idli, on the other hand, was light and fluffy, melting in your mouth. It was perfectly steamed and paired wonderfully with the flavorful sambar. The service was prompt and attentive, making for a very enjoyable dining experience.

In the Middle of a busy street There is the Resturant specially for dosa and some other south Indian dishes. Well, one can also get Thali, plain roti and ICE creams. The hotel area is so seems good though Not the best in Terms of Hygiene. Also, the toilet is Not at all Hygiene. Try to avoid it.

Ordered online through Drutoo app. Worst pao bhaji of my life. No butter at all inside the pao. Uttapam is too costly. Only thing that was fine was the dosa and coconut chutney.

The fat guy sitting at the cash counter is a thief. He took 200 rupees from me and didn't return the change saying he doesn't have change...and the next day when i went to get my money back he said he doesn't know me. Very cheap and cheater.

Overall Rating: 0/5 (If there was an option for negative, I’d give that)

Food Quality: 1/5
The biryani was absolutely tasteless. For a price of ₹350+ per plate (and only full plate option available), the quality was far below expectations. Not worth the money at all.

Customer Service: 0/5
One of the worst customer service experiences I’ve had. The staff didn’t behave properly, showed no respect to customers, and literally threw the food on the table. Zero professionalism.

Ambience & Management: 1/5
The environment was not welcoming and the management clearly doesn't care about customer satisfaction. No proper service system in place.

Value for Money: 0/5
Totally overpriced for what they offer. A complete disappointment.

Overall Experience: 0/5
Luckily, I went alone. Had I brought someone with me, I would have been embarrassed. Easily the worst restaurant I’ve visited in Silchar.

We tried Malai murg kebab, pan-fried fish, chicken in peri peri sauce, mixed chilli garlic noodles, Singapore chicken noodles, mutton biryani, butter chicken, Afghan chicken, chilli chicken, Kung Pao chicken, and prawns in butter garlic sauce.

The kebabs were tender and juicy but lacked the smokiness you look for in kebabs. The pan-fried fish was absolutely stunning. The fish was soft and tender and packed with flavour. I highly recommend it. The peri peri chicken was really good too though I wish the chicken were a bit more succulent.

The mixed chilli garlic noodles was, for me, the highlight, of the evening. It was just perfect. I wish I could the say the same about the Singapore rice noodles. I found the taste very bland. The chilli chicken, similarly, lacked both heat and flavour. I wouldn't order it again. The Kung Pao chicken, while not bad, was not seasoned properly. It desperately needed more salt and spices. The butter garlic prawns were atrocious. The prawns were overcooked and salty. There was not even a hint of garlic. Frankly, I make better garlic prawns at home.

The mutton biryani was pretty good. The mutton was perfectly cooked and just melted in my mouth. The butter chicken, however, was very disappointing. The chicken wasn't cooked well and the gravy was too sour. The Afghan chicken, on the other hand, was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend it.

Would I revisit this restaurant? Probably yes, but only for the ambience. The food, however, is nothing extraordinary, and frankly, quite overpriced. You can find better food at cheaper rates in plenty of other restaurants in Silchar.

Edit: Revisited the restaurant yesterday. The service has gone down considerably since I last visited. The waiters seem to be in a hurry to throw out customers from the restaurant. Even though there were no new customers waiting for a table, the wait staff cleared out our table without even waiting for us to finish our desserts. They brought us the bill the moment we were done with our mains. Such behaviour is not acceptable unless the customers are being particularly rowdy or indecent which we weren't. Serving bad food is bad enough. But this sort of inhospitability is truly unpardonable. At least give your guests a few minutes to digest the food before you throw them out.
Service: 1/5

Good food and ambience. Good location too - easily accessible. We have been there for dinner and lunch and can heartily recommend both. caring service, big surprize every time food came to the table - it just looked so awesome and tasted even better.We enjoyed a lovely early dinner in Tuljak, it was raining, so we stayed inside. We had the starters platter for two, which was good, but very overpriced. Along with the cafe restaurant 🍹

Brotherhood Cafe is a hidden gem in Silchar! The interiors are modern, and the seating arrangement is spacious. The food is impressive, with generous portions and a range of continental and Indian options. Their desserts, particularly the brownies, are a must-try. Service is friendly, but it can be a bit slow during peak hours. Overall, a great spot to hang out with friends and enjoy a hearty meal.

There is no parking lot as such. There is however, an open space in front of the restaurant, where you can keep your vehicles parked.

My go to restaurant in Silchar. I love the decor and the mojitos but sadly despite being one of the best in town they always have some item out of stock.
Personally love their arabiatta pasta, tandoori and afghani chicken, also drums of heaven or was it chicken drumstick 🤔... one of the two was superyum.... but the naan is a big let down, naan here is more like bread which should not be the case.

Despite being this good I am giving only 3 stars because on NY eve they organised a rooftop live music for which they charged 150/head, and the singer was aweful + the chairs and overall decor on the rooftop looked more like a shaddi ka set up

Ambiance is nice. But food,portion size and service is pathetic. Ordered chilli potato but got chilli paneer,ordered coke but got sprite. Afghan chicken was very bland,undercooked and portion size was laughable.

Even though they got famous in entire silchar within a very short period of time, customer hospitality is something they should learn.. No complaints about quality of food ... But the manager of that cafe shud learn some manners and attending to customer first... Customer is god ... Should know how to respect them

The food in Brotherhood Cafe is very very tasty... Their Chicken Momo is so so unique then other places available. The soup is awesome, the momo was loaded with chicken, veggies,etc. The size is very big compared to others and is butter brushed. And the roll is very yummy..

Very bad experience.We had ordered biriyani and they gave us staled chicken and the biriyani rice was also sticky. Ordered starter and received the biriyani as a starter and also had to ask them for the already ordered cold drinks.This restaurant needs to cease immediately.
Had to pay ~50% money for the staled food which we didn't eat.
DON'T DISTORT ETHICS.

Food is okay okay... Expected more from this cafe as it's new and also at the heart of the city...one good thing, they have lot of varieties but I doubt if everything would be available at any given point of time... unfortunately I forgot to take enough pictures and that my bad... Price is bit high but considering the ambience it's reasonable... Recommended place for lunch and dinner date with your loved ones.... For food I would give 3/5 star and for ambience I rate 5/5...

Worst taste in Silchar!
Order hyderabadi biryani which is 300₹ for just 1 small bowl & got Pulaao.
The chicken & rice tasted burnt, just ate 1 spoon & couldn’t eat anymore.
Do not waste your money in this cafe although the interior is really nice

I visited this restaurant with my wife during Ramadan and it truly has an authentic Mughal halal vibe. Probably the only one of its kind in Barak Valley. The place is spacious, beautifully decorated and perfect for families. The staff is welcoming and their behavior adds to the charm of the place.

The location is a bit far from the main town but that actually makes it more comfortable with less traffic. The food is a mix of highs and lows. Ghost Bhuna is overpriced for the portion size. Just 3-4 small pieces which don’t justify the cost compared to places like Mughal Garden in Guwahati or other state popular spots. I’d give it 3 stars. Nihari is decent but doesn’t match the rich flavors of Kolkata or other well-known spots. Pulao was great but the Biryani was a letdown. It lacked the aroma and depth of flavors you expect from places like Mughal Garden or Hyderabad-style biryani. Definitely needs improvement.

Still, most of the dishes were enjoyable and for a place in Barak Valley, it’s a solid 4-star experience. If you’re looking for halal food with a variety of options and a proper family-friendly setting, this is a good choice.

Visited today on my friend’s recommendation. The restaurant is clean and tidy with a decent ambiance. The food is also quite good. We ordered chicken biryani and mutton laas maas. The biryani was decent. The laas maas was not the actual laas maas, but was some kinda red non-spicy masala chicken; tasted fine though. Lassi was good. The quality of butter naan was also fine.

Upon entering Restaurant, I was immediately struck by the sophisticated yet inviting ambiance. Soft lighting and contemporary décor created an elegant atmosphere perfect for a special dinner. The service at Restaurant was impeccable. The staff was attentive, knowledgeable about the menu, and provided excellent recommendations. They ensured that all our needs were met without being intrusive.The food at Restaurant exceeded my expectations. Each dish was beautifully presented and bursting with flavor. We had biriyani it was awesome. The menu offered a diverse selection. The price of the food is not so on higer end its medium range. My experience at Restaurant was nothing short of exceptional. Everyone should visit this restaurant.

This Shree Nawab Restaurant near Hotel Ellora, Silchar. It is basically a non-vegetarian restaurant with only four veg options paneer pakora, butter paneer masala, paneer biryani and paneer bamboo biriyani. Today we have tried paneer bamboo biriyani, it was great simply fingure licking. And take a packing of Mutton Rogan Jos and Chicken Kosha. Non-vegetarian dishes are nice. The only thing which I find problematic is space otherwise the place was great to visit for friends and family

Shree Nawab Restaurant in Silchar is a gem for biryani lovers. We tried the Kolkata Mutton Dum Biryani, and it was simply awesome—flavorful, tender, and perfectly cooked. The prices are reasonable, making it great value for money. While the ambiance could use an upgrade, everything else about the experience was delightful. Definitely a must-visit for anyone in the area!

Sorry for the inconveniences mam. We reuse the bamboos for making the Biryani.
We charge just ₹20 for bamboo packing for one bamboo biryani.
Not ₹40 .

We will rethink about the charges mam. Sorry, for the staff behavior.
We will take strict actions against the staffs.

It took 1.5 hours to make a delivery ordered through swiggy. The swiggy executive had no fault of his own. The restaurant took 1.5 hours to make 3 plates of normal biryani! This is how they address the hunger needs. Speaks of their unprofessionalism on one hand and inefficiency on another.

The service of Navwab restora is very poor as they have taken order from us arround 8.15 pm but till 9.35pm they are unable to serve the order after asking the question why they are unable to serve the food they said it will take another 5 to 10 minutes after that we decided to leave the resotra. Very poor service.

Excellent biriyani. Had the nawab spl mutton one, very good. They took a LOOOOOOOONG time to serve the order tho, so one star off. But hands down, best biriyani in Silchar by far. Juicy, flavorful and some uniquely creamy textures you don't often see in Awadhi cuisine, and great quantities.

It's a face saver of the SILCHAR town. With other places losing their business and the will to improve this place is a tinge of fresh leaf in the soil. The bamboo chicken Biryani is an instant hit. Although the bamboo flavours are not overpowering. It's below the centre point hotel. Kababs and tandoor items are also worth a try

We are extremely saddened to learn regarding your bad experience.Actually we usually serve only one chutney with our momos.On special occassion as spl offer we serve extra green chutney or mayo or mustard sauce.Mayo is served with Mayoneese Momo.Regarding the extra chilli in the stuffing,may be a little bit extra chilly went by mistake in the stuffing on that day.We are sorry.Hoping to give you a better experience in the future.

Food is good specially the Fish and Prawn s. But it would be great if addition of sugar could be avoided.
Don't go for the interior or amenities but sure for the starters. Cheers...!

Getting to Ranna Ghar in Silchar is a bit tricky due to the narrow approach road, but the visit was worth it. The food was tasty, service was good, and the pricing felt reasonable. I tried a thali, and the portion size was satisfying. However, the chingri (prawn) pieces had very little meat, which was a letdown. Overall, a good experience with room for small improvements.

I recently had the pleasure of dining at Rannaghar, and I must say, it's a haven for those craving authentic Bengali cuisine. This restaurant truly stands out for its impressive spread of Bengali dishes.
From traditional favorites to innovative combinations, there's something for every palate. Each thali is meticulously prepared, with a focus on using fresh, locally sourced ingredients that elevate the flavors and textures of each dish.
With its extensive menu, delicious food, and welcoming ambiance, this restaurant is sure to leave you feeling satisfied and eager to return. Whether you're a Bengali food aficionado or just looking to try something new, Rannaghar is an excellent choice.

They are just frauds waiting out there to scam people, ordered chicken kasha and gondhoraj chicken from here last night..the chicken kasha was pathetic and stale and the godhoraj chicken was bitter, due to addition of whole pieces of lemon in the dish and we know the rind turns anything bitter if added in excess.

We are truly sorry to hear about your recent experience with our food. Your feedback is very important to us, and we sincerely apologize for not meeting your expectations.
We take great pride in the quality of our dishes, and it is disappointing to know that the Chicken Kasha and Gondhoraj Chicken did not reflect our usual standards. The bitterness in the Gondhoraj Chicken, possibly due to the lemon rind, and the issue with the Chicken Kasha being stale, are both concerns we take very seriously.
Please be assured that we have already raised this matter with our kitchen team to ensure such mistakes are not repeated. We would appreciate the opportunity to make this right for you. If you're open to it, kindly share your order details with us via direct message or call us at 9706421124, and we’d love to offer a replacement meal or a refund as per your preference.

I'm sorry to hear about your experience navigating through Silchar. It sounds like you encountered some challenges with transportation and finding your way around the city. Navigating unfamiliar cities can indeed be frustrating, especially when it comes to locating specific addresses and dealing with transportation issues. Hopefully, your next visit to Silchar or any other city will be more enjoyable and less chaotic.

It's been a clear mistake / misunderstanding on your part. Offers shown in any food delivery platform are not binding on restaurant menu as such. It is provided by that platform and they send the required request to the restaurant. If the food delivery platform doesn't show, we can't provide the same. Plus any discount availed cannot be clubbed with any offer as far as we know. Please check and verify with the respected delivery platform as we don't have any data regarding it except for the KOT.

Never judge a book by its cover. A small yet awsome restaurant i must say. What matters at the end of the day is the taste of the food and its definitely one of the best in the town..

They have the best fried foods in this Silchar town! For me the spacious and peaceful ambience is like a cherry on the cake to the delicious and quality food.
