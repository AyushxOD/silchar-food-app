Shree Nawab Restaurant, Central Road (owner)
2 weeks ago
Dear Ms. Ishani Bhattacharjee,
Thank you for taking the time to write to us and for being a valued regular guest of Shree Nawab Restaurant. We are extremely sorry to hear about your recent experience, and we take your feedback with the seriousness and urgency it deserves.

First and foremost, please accept our sincerest apologies for the disappointment, frustration, and disrespect you felt during your visit. Your loyalty means a lot to us, and it is deeply concerning to know that we failed to meet your expectations.



Regarding Pricing Transparency:

You’re absolutely right to question the pricing of half plates. We acknowledge that the current pricing model lacks clarity, and this can come across as unfair. We are in the process of standardizing and clearly communicating half-plate pricing on our menu to avoid confusion going forward. We appreciate you bringing this to our attention.



On Reward Points:



We are equally concerned to learn that you were denied the use of your earned reward points. While technical issues can occasionally occur, they should never result in a customer feeling cheated or dismissed. A manual adjustment should have been offered without hesitation. We are reviewing this incident internally and will ensure that such lapses do not occur again. As a gesture of goodwill, we would like to credit ₹200 worth of reward points to your account immediately.



Staff Conduct:



What you described regarding the behavior of our staff is completely unacceptable and not reflective of our values. We are already identifying the individuals involved, and necessary corrective action — including retraining and disciplinary measures — will be taken. Every guest, especially a loyal one like yourself, deserves to be treated with respect, empathy, and professionalism at all times.



Food Quality:



Your comment about the Mutton Biryani containing mostly bones is very concerning. We are investigating this with our kitchen team and quality control staff. Our goal is to ensure that every portion served meets high standards — in quality, portion, and presentation. Any deviation from this is not acceptable to us either.



On Asking for Reviews:



We apologize if you were asked to leave a review while your concerns were unresolved. That should never happen. Genuine service must always come first, and only then can feedback — whether good or bad — be honestly requested.

Please know that we are taking this matter very seriously and are implementing the following actions:

Revising pricing policy for half plates.

Overhauling the handling of reward point redemptions.

Conducting customer service training for all front-end staff.

Auditing portion quality across key dishes.



We truly value your patronage and your honesty. While we are saddened that we let you down, we are grateful that you cared enough to tell us. If you would consider giving us another opportunity to serve you, we would be more than happy to make things right — not just in words, but through actions.

It's been a clear mistake / misunderstanding on your part. Offers shown in any food delivery platform are not binding on restaurant menu as such. It is provided by that platform and they send the required request to the restaurant. If the food delivery platform doesn't show, we can't provide the same. Plus any discount availed cannot be clubbed with any offer as far as we know. Please check and verify with the respected delivery platform as we don't have any data regarding it except for the KOT.

I ordered 3 Veg zinger burgers with cheese slice but I received 3 normal zinger burgers without any cheese. This is really disappointing as I paid extra for the cheese in the burgers & found only some mayonnaise. This is the second time I am facing such issues. The last time I ordered a combo & the cold beverage was missing. …More

My niece ordered sweets and cake from Sanju’s via Swiggy but only cake was delivered not the sweets. Complained about the incident but didn’t respond even after several approaches. Very disappointing and unprofessional act

Great food and the menu has many exotic pork dishes which are a must try. But what stands out for me is the quality of the Pork meat. I think its the best in the town.

They have cheated me with what I have ordered from them through swiggy. i ordered them pork american chopsuey but there was no pork in it. It was a very embarrassing moment for me as my guest where expecting pork. Really saddened to see the irresponsible way of work done by them.

Don't go for it, you order something and you will get another thing and taste is below average. Totally disgusting.

You already knew it was a mishap from the delivery guy and nothing to do with us. The delivery guy misplaced your delivery. And it was acknowledged by them, in the complain we both raised.You were intimated of that by both Drutoo and Us. We are not at blame here for something that was of no fault of ours. We however still offered you the same thing on the house as a gesture of good faith and will. Do understand we are not bound or anything to offer you that. We offered to do it as sign of good gesture. We thought of sending it to you at dinner as you ordered the last one during dinner time. That was the only folly on our part and we are sorry for that. We are sorry that being human we forgot you requested the same to be delivered to you by 4 pm. We are sorry for that. Yet again we would mention it's our good gesture and not something we owe you or anything. We don't owe you. You don't owe us.

We have processed the order. Eat it, give it away, throw it. It's upto you. Though we would prefer you not throwing it away. And giving it to someone who might need it.
And next time don't down rate someone when you know that they are not at fault and you just expect freebees courtesy of their good nature.
We wish you best. Take care. Godspeed.
